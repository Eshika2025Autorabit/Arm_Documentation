Steps to set the docker-
1.On the rabit repository go Dockerfile and remove "-dev" from line no. 30 - 
COPY frontend/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
2.Now go to docker-compose.yml file and run the docker container. 
 
3.Now try to run localhost:8091- It will ask for user password and username.
4.For that start the dynamo db and go to nosql workbench and search for userpassword table there we need to set up.
   Set Attribute name-currentPassword 
   Set operator - "="
   Set Type- String
   Set Attribute value -$2a$12$uQCYAIdkjN6WSwZ4Jc1AGuYP/vmSl8sac4.uOOrn4659nVXlvmZW.
   and then click scan
5.Then go to localhost:8091 and create a user for demo, there replace the old password with the new password.
6.Now once login create the salesforce org and vc org.
7.For localhost:8091 to run the docker should be started and db should be started and tomcat should also be started.
8. To create the sales force org-
     Go to sales org and fill the name, provider as oauth and validate.
      It will show the regret page and then correct the port of the url to 8955/rabit/
     Then login page ill open, fill the credentials.
     After login page will open where you need to allow.
    After allow  we redirect to http://localhost:8955/rabit/oauth/_callback?code=
    Then for the above url change the port to 8091 (frontend) and remove /rabit/
    Then you will get the new user created to salesforce org page on arm application.
9. For docker there will be change in config of two files- > nginx-dev.conf and nginx.conf
10. Comment the lines in UserServiceImpl.java  from 372 to 381 and 390 to 393 to avoid the following error-
 
LOG.error("Admin mail body is empty. Please check the admin template and update it.");
//            throw new RabitServicesException(ExceptionCode.MAILBODYEMPTY.getCode(), ExceptionCode.MAILBODYEMPTY.getDescription());
//        }
 
11.To create vc org-
Create the repo on githib using autorabit email and then craete one classic token and copy it.
Then on the vc org option of the arm app name the vc org and paste the url of the repo.
Then choose the git branch and provide the credentials the username and the token as the password.
Then the vc org is created and then chk the mapping and the connection.
